- **User does the QA** - AI guides testing, user runs tests locally/in browser
- **This file is allowed to be sprawling** - It's the beating heart of the project

### üß† Guiding Philosophy:
- **Transparency > Cleverness**
- **Stability > Speed**
- **Performance > Convention**
- **Explicitness > DRY if it aids readability**
- **Centralization of knowledge > scattershot insight buried in files**

## üîç LEVEL SET SUMMARY

- **Project name**: Still Marker
- **Purpose**: Lightweight web tool for filmmakers to extract high-quality still images from video files
- **Audience / users**: Filmmakers who need to extract stills for marketing, thumbnails, archival, etc.
- **Most important outcome**: **High quality image extraction** - getting video to render out images PROPERLY
- **Visual vs performance vs design**: Simple and easy to use, cinematic minimal aesthetic, but not flashy/slick
- **Performance priority**: High - app should be INSANELY fast, vanilla JS for minimal bloat
- **SEO priority**: Low - single-purpose tool
- **Maintenance over time**: Single release with minor iterations - do one thing perfectly
- **Deployment target**: Netlify (Functions + Static hosting)
- **Initial feature list**:
  - [ ] Upload video file (up to 2GB)
  - [ ] Extract frames at 3-second intervals (JPEG 95% quality)
  - [ ] Display frames as thumbnail grid
  - [ ] Click thumbnails to view larger
  - [ ] Download extracted images
  - [ ] "Shift +1s" offset feature for re-extraction
  - [ ] Progress indication during processing
  - [ ] Clear privacy messaging
- **Tech constraints / requests from user**:
  - [ ] Vanilla JS frontend (reinvent wheel if needed for performance)
  - [ ] Netlify Functions for server-side processing
  - [ ] FFmpeg for frame extraction
  - [ ] Privacy-first: immediate file deletion after processing
  - [ ] No user accounts, analytics, or tracking
- **File size limits**: 2GB maximum (covers most short films, reels, demo footage)
- **Processing approach**: One file at a time, server-side via Netlify Functions
- **Privacy model**: Server-side processing with immediate deletion (within minutes)
- **Design sensibilities**: Cinematic minimal - A24 website meets professional tool. Clean, white space, beautiful typography, subtle animations. Reference: VSCO or Halide camera app elegance. Made BY filmmakers FOR filmmakers.
- **Accessibility**: Basic WCAG compliance (keyboard navigation, screen reader friendly)
- **User proficiency**: Assume they know video but not tech. Smart defaults for everything.

## üèóÔ∏è TECH ARCHITECTURE (NATIVE MAC APP)

*Architecture after pivot to native Mac app:*

- **Framework / language**: Swift + SwiftUI
  - *Rationale: Native performance, modern UI framework, excellent for Mac development*
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI with macOS 12+ (Monterey) target
  - *Rationale: Modern, declarative UI, excellent for cinematic minimal aesthetic*
- **Video processing**: Bundled FFmpeg binary
  - *Rationale: Out-of-box experience, no user setup required, consistent performance*
- **File handling**: Direct file system access via NSOpenPanel
  - *Rationale: True privacy, instant processing, no size limits*
- **State management**: SwiftUI @StateObject and @ObservableObject
  - *Rationale: Built-in reactive state management*
- **Distribution**: Local development ‚Üí Direct download + Mac App Store exploration
  - *Rationale: Flexible distribution strategy, test both channels*
- **Directory structure plan**:
  ```

- **Key dependencies**: 
  - AVFoundation (built-in video analysis)
  - FFmpeg binary (bundled for frame extraction)
  - AppKit (file dialogs, native Mac integration)
- **Planned dev workflow**: Xcode with SwiftUI previews and live development
- **Testing approach**: Manual QA with user, focus on real-world filmmaker workflows

## üóÇÔ∏è LEGACY WEB ARCHITECTURE (COMPLETED BUT PIVOTED)

*Original web-based architecture (M1/M2 completed successfully):*
- Vanilla JavaScript frontend (‚úÖ completed)
- Netlify Functions backend (‚úÖ completed)
- FFmpeg server-side processing (‚úÖ completed)
- **LIMITATION**: 6MB request limit made real-world use impossible
