# PROJECT_SPEC.md

‚ö†Ô∏è This is the **living god file** for Still Marker. Every architectural decision, design tradeoff, and project evolution must be documented here. This file is the source of truth for all collaborators.

---

## üî∞ PURPOSE OF THIS FILE

- Serves as the **canonical source of truth** for the Still Marker project
- Evolves over time, **growing with every decision**, mistake, fix, or insight
- **Future collaborators (human or AI)** must be able to read this file and understand how the project works, why it's built the way it is, and what to do next

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è ETHOS AND EXPECTATIONS

### ‚úÖ Project Expectations:
- **Document everything** - Every architectural decision, design tradeoff, mistake made and fixed
- **Specs over assumptions** - When in doubt, ask for clarification
- **No magic** - Code must be explainable to any collaborator
- **Work in stable milestones** - Each chunk of progress must be committable and testable
- **User does the QA** - AI guides testing, user runs tests locally/in browser
- **This file is allowed to be sprawling** - It's the beating heart of the project

### üß† Guiding Philosophy:
- **Transparency > Cleverness**
- **Stability > Speed**
- **Performance > Convention**
- **Explicitness > DRY if it aids readability**
- **Centralization of knowledge > scattershot insight buried in files**

### üé® VISUAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR STILL MARKER:

#### Typography & Identity:
- Make "STILL MARKER" an architectural element, not just a label
- Consider unconventional placement: vertical stacking, extreme letter spacing (S T I L L   M A R K E R), or using individual letters as design elements
- Think gallery signage or editorial design - this is for cinematographers who understand visual language

#### Interface Atmosphere:
- Design with cinematic lighting in mind - subtle gradients, atmospheric depth
- Use lifted blacks (#1a1a1d instead of #000000) - filmmakers know pure black is amateur
- Glass morphism done right: panels that feel like high-end camera filters
- Multiple subtle "light sources" creating depth without distraction

#### Hierarchy & Restraint:
- Create hierarchy through opacity (0.9, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3) not garish colors
- One prominent action at a time - respect the user's focus
- Generous space around primary actions - this isn't a cluttered NLE

#### The Key Test:
**"Would a tired cinematographer appreciate this at 3am after a 14-hour shoot?"** Beautiful but NEVER at the expense of clarity. These are professionals who need tools that work.

### üé¨ Chris Marker Aesthetic References:

#### Essay Film Sensibility:
- Interface as visual essay - thoughtful, contemplative pacing
- La Jet√©e inspired: Still frames are the star - present them like museum pieces, each one precious
- Typography as narrative: Text that feels hand-typed, documentary-like - consider monospace fonts or subtle typewriter aesthetics

#### Black & White Emphasis:
- While we use color, consider a mode or elements that reference Marker's B&W work
- Perhaps frame previews could have a B&W option for artistic evaluation

#### Time as Texture:
- The "Shift +1s" feature is very Marker - make time manipulation feel poetic, not just functional
- Observational clarity: Marker's work was never cluttered - every element had purpose and breathing room

#### Digital Light Table Philosophy:
Think of the interface as a digital light table where a film essayist might examine their work. This isn't just extracting frames - it's studying moments, finding the punctum in the footage.

**Apply this sensibility especially to:**
- How frames are presented in the grid (gallery-like, contemplative)
- The typography treatment (could reference typewriter/documentary aesthetics)  
- The overall pacing and space of the interface

## üîç LEVEL SET SUMMARY

- **Project name**: Still Marker
- **Purpose**: Lightweight web tool for filmmakers to extract high-quality still images from video files
- **Audience / users**: Filmmakers who need to extract stills for marketing, thumbnails, archival, etc.
- **Most important outcome**: **High quality image extraction** - getting video to render out images PROPERLY
- **Visual vs performance vs design**: Simple and easy to use, cinematic minimal aesthetic, but not flashy/slick
- **Performance priority**: High - app should be INSANELY fast, vanilla JS for minimal bloat
- **SEO priority**: Low - single-purpose tool
- **Maintenance over time**: Single release with minor iterations - do one thing perfectly
- **Deployment target**: Netlify (Functions + Static hosting)
- **Initial feature list**:
  - [ ] Upload video file (up to 2GB)
  - [ ] Extract frames at 3-second intervals (JPEG 95% quality)
  - [ ] Display frames as thumbnail grid
  - [ ] Click thumbnails to view larger
  - [ ] Download extracted images
  - [ ] "Shift +1s" offset feature for re-extraction
  - [ ] Progress indication during processing
  - [ ] Clear privacy messaging
- **Tech constraints / requests from user**:
  - [ ] Vanilla JS frontend (reinvent wheel if needed for performance)
  - [ ] Netlify Functions for server-side processing
  - [ ] FFmpeg for frame extraction
  - [ ] Privacy-first: immediate file deletion after processing
  - [ ] No user accounts, analytics, or tracking
- **File size limits**: 2GB maximum (covers most short films, reels, demo footage)
- **Processing approach**: One file at a time, server-side via Netlify Functions
- **Privacy model**: Server-side processing with immediate deletion (within minutes)
- **Design sensibilities**: Cinematic minimal - A24 website meets professional tool. Clean, white space, beautiful typography, subtle animations. Reference: VSCO or Halide camera app elegance. Made BY filmmakers FOR filmmakers.
- **Accessibility**: Basic WCAG compliance (keyboard navigation, screen reader friendly)
- **User proficiency**: Assume they know video but not tech. Smart defaults for everything.

## üèóÔ∏è TECH ARCHITECTURE (NATIVE MAC APP)

*Architecture after pivot to native Mac app:*

- **Framework / language**: Swift + SwiftUI
  - *Rationale: Native performance, modern UI framework, excellent for Mac development*
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI with macOS 12+ (Monterey) target
  - *Rationale: Modern, declarative UI, excellent for cinematic minimal aesthetic*
- **Video processing**: Bundled FFmpeg binary
  - *Rationale: Out-of-box experience, no user setup required, consistent performance*
- **File handling**: Direct file system access via NSOpenPanel
  - *Rationale: True privacy, instant processing, no size limits*
- **State management**: SwiftUI @StateObject and @ObservableObject
  - *Rationale: Built-in reactive state management*
- **Distribution**: Local development ‚Üí Direct download + Mac App Store exploration
  - *Rationale: Flexible distribution strategy, test both channels*
- **Directory structure plan**:
  ```

## üß† TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Architecture Decisions Made

**Performance Optimization (RESOLVED):**
- **Issue**: Original 8.6s delay in video duration analysis using FFmpeg
- **Solution**: Replaced with AVFoundation metadata reading (~10ms)
- **Impact**: Instant app launch, dramatically improved UX

**macOS Compatibility:**
- **Target**: macOS 12+ (Monterey) for broad compatibility
- **SwiftUI**: Pure SwiftUI approach chosen over NSView hybrids for reliability
- **Gesture Handling**: Custom tap gesture implementation for macOS 12+ compatibility

**FFmpeg Integration:**
- **Bundled Binary**: Intel FFmpeg binary included (works on Apple Silicon via Rosetta)
- **Processing**: Async frame extraction with progress tracking
- **Quality**: JPEG 95% quality for optimal file size/quality balance

### Adaptive Frame Extraction Algorithm

```swift
func calculateFrameInterval(videoDuration: Double) -> Double {
    let targetFrames = 30
    let maxFrames = 40
    let minInterval = 0.5  // Don't extract more than 2 frames per second
    
    // Very short videos (< 30s): every 1 second
    if videoDuration < 30 {
        return 1.0
    }
    
    // Medium videos (30s - 5min): aim for ~30 frames
    if videoDuration <= 300 {  // 5 minutes
        let interval = videoDuration / Double(targetFrames)
        // Round to nearest 0.5 second for cleaner timestamps
        return max(round(interval * 2) / 2, minInterval)
    }
    
    // Long videos (> 5min): cap at 40 frames
    let interval = videoDuration / Double(maxFrames)
    return max(round(interval * 2) / 2, minInterval)
}

// Usage example:
let interval = calculateFrameInterval(videoDuration: 48.92)
// Returns: 1.5 seconds (giving ~32 frames for a 49s video)
```

**Benefits:**
- **15-second commercial**: 15 frames at 1s intervals
- **2-minute music video**: ~30 frames at 4s intervals 
- **10-minute short film**: 40 frames at 15s intervals
- **Consistent filmmaker experience** across content lengths
- **Performance optimization** for long-form content
